                    I outline and play around with a trick that often gets used to regularise oscillating and divergent integrals.
		            After a couple of simple examples, I apply this to the Casimir effect and show the the difference between an diverging series and a diverging integral is -1/12.
		            While counterintuitive, this difference is something that can actually be measured.

                    The Jacobi-Anger expansion is a way to decompose a plane wave into angular harmonics and Bessel functions.
                    This decomposition is very useful when solving a wide range of wave scattering problems.
                    In this post, I'll explain why it makes sense to try and write a plane wave in terms of Bessel funcions and show how the Jacobi-Anger expansion can be derived by considering the Fourier series of a plane wave.
                    We'll conclude with some numerical checks that all of the maths makes sense.
