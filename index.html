		<p align="left">I am a theoretical physics PhD student within the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Metamaterials, where I work with Simon Horsley and Alastair Hibbins to explore the space of electromagnetic materials, with applications to antenna design. </p>

		<p align="left">In 2019 I graduated from the University of Exeter with a Masters degree in physics, also winning the Bertie Black prize for the highest performing finalist and the Newman prize for the best masters project in terms of ingenuity and intuition shown.  As part of my degree, I spent 14 months working at a science and technology consultancy in Cambridge, where I played a key role developing cutting edge technologies for diverse markets, such as medical devices and 3D printing.  The results of my work are currently in use with several clients worldwide. </p>
		
		<p align="left">My researched is focused on solve inverse design problems in optics and photonics to engineer how waves are scattered for a range of applications. </p>
